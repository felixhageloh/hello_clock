Hello Clock
===========

A little test app to play with Firefox OS (everyone needs a clock, right?). 

## viewing the app

host the public folder using your favorite web server ([Anvil](http://anvilformac.com) is great if you are on a mac) and point your browser to <tt>index.html</tt>

## modifying the app

You'll need to have CoffeeScript and grunt installed. In case you haven't
	
	npm install -g coffeescript
	npm install -g grunt-cli
	
Then run 
	
	grunt
	
which will start a server on port 8000, listen to changes to the code and build the app.
